README for elktop version 1.0
=============================


ABOUT

  elktop is clone from mytop which is a `top' clone for MySQL

  elktop is a tool for monitoring ELK Clusters.
  It runs on most Unix systems which have Perl, DBI, and Term::ReadKey
  installed. And with Term::ANSIColor installed you even get color. As
  of version 0.7, it even runs on Windows (somewhat).

  Original Code is from mytop from Jeremy D. Zawodny <Jeremy@Zawodny.com>

INSTALLATION

  tar -zxvf elktop-<version>.tar.gz
  cd elktop-<version>
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

  The test is a bit stupid, but it's there from completeness.

DOCUMENTATION

  man elktop
